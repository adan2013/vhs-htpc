# VHS HTPC Project

This repository contains the source code of my DIY project called VHS HTPC. The device has been made from an old VHS player (Panasonic NV-J35HQ) and an old laptop (ASUS K75VJ). The device is controlled by a remote control from Sony's soundbar. The remote allows you to turn on/off the device and control the operating system. The device is also equipped with a 7-segment LCD screen that displays the current time, status of the PC and the current temperature of CPU.

## Features

1. IR remote control
2. 7-segment 4-digit LCD screen
3. Real-time clock and CPU temperature monitoring
4. 3 different modes of LCD operation
5. Easily accessible keyboard shortcuts
6. Predefined apps and websites shortcuts
7. OS integration (e.g. volume control, switching between apps, clipboard etc.)
